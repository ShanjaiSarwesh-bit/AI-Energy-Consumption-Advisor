## 3. SDG Alignment

### Primary SDG
- **SDG 7 – Affordable and Clean Energy**

### Secondary SDG
- **SDG 13 – Climate Action**

This project promotes efficient energy usage and reduces electricity wastage, supporting clean energy goals and contributing to lower carbon emissions through optimized energy consumption.

---

## 4. Problem Statement
Educational institutions consume a large amount of electrical energy daily due to classrooms, laboratories, hostels, libraries, and administrative buildings. In many colleges, electricity usage is not continuously monitored or analyzed, leading to inefficient consumption, energy wastage, higher operational costs, and increased environmental impact.

**Problem Statement:**  
*How might we use AI to analyze energy consumption patterns in college campuses so that electricity usage becomes more efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable?*

---

## 5. Target Users
- College administrators  
- Facility and maintenance managers  
- Teaching and non-teaching staff  
- Students  

---

## 6. AI Solution Overview
The proposed solution is an **AI-based Smart Energy Consumption Advisor** that analyzes historical electricity usage data of a college campus and provides meaningful insights and recommendations.

The system uses prompt-based AI workflows to:
- Understand energy consumption trends  
- Identify peak usage periods  
- Detect possible inefficiencies  
- Generate sustainability-focused recommendations  

The AI system acts as a **decision-support tool** and does not replace human judgment.

---

## 7. Role of AI in the Project
Artificial Intelligence is used to:
- Interpret and summarize electricity consumption data  
- Detect recurring patterns and unusual spikes  
- Identify potential causes of energy wastage  
- Generate actionable energy-saving recommendations  
- Explain insights in a simple, conversational manner  

This demonstrates responsible and practical AI usage without complex coding.
